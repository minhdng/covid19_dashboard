![]()

## Description

This project explores COVID-19 using the [JHU CSSE Covid-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Data and the [NYC Health open data](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) released by the NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 Data, along with the NYC open restaurant data.   

The focus of this project is to create an interactive dashboard for public use. In this dashboard we provide the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 globally and across US states. Users can also use this app to find restaurant suggestions based on COVID infection rate trend sorted by ZIP code. Users will enjoy interacting with the map to locate their designated areas of choice and to find available restaurants. From there, the app also provide some main information about restaurants, including alcohol preference and dine-in options.  

The app is live [**here**](https://minh-d-nguyen.shinyapps.io/covid-19-dashboard/)
